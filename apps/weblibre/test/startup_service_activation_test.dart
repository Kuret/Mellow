/// listeners — and the inactivity is transitive, because an inactive element's
/// own `watch`/`listen` subscriptions are deactivated in turn. A service
/// started with `read` therefore builds once and then stops seeing changes,
/// with no error and nothing in the log.

/// In the full browser that hides: widgets watch the same upstream providers
/// and reactivate the chain. On the headless Custom Tab / PWA launch path
/// nothing does, and a cold start sat forever with the container routing gate
/// reporting all five inputs unresolved while the identical queries answered in
/// single-digit milliseconds.
///
/// A unit test cannot catch this — the provider tests activate services
/// correctly, which is exactly why they all passed while production hung — so
/// the activation site itself is what gets pinned here.
