/// The two record kinds get deliberately different treatment, because only one
/// of them can be attributed:
///
/// - **Proxy credentials** are keyed by proxy-profile UUID, and the row that
///   uses them lives in *this* profile's `user.db`. So ownership is a lookup,
///   not a guess: a secret is claimed only when this profile actually has the
///   proxy profile that references it. Another profile's secrets are left
///   untouched for it to claim when it activates.
/// - **The account record** has no such evidence anywhere — no profile database
///   holds account state, it all lives in secure storage. So it is *left alone*
///   rather than attributed. Handing it to whichever profile happens to boot
///   first would be the same mistake as filing another profile's history under
///   whichever profile won startup, and this plan refuses that everywhere
///   else.
///
/// Leaving it un-attributed would cost the user a sign-in they never asked for,
/// which is why it is not the end of the story: the one party that *does* know
/// which profile the account belongs to is the user, and
/// `findUnclaimedAccountRecord` offers it to them by name rather than guessing
/// or discarding. Until they answer, the record stays readable under its
/// original key so nothing — including an older build — loses access to it.
