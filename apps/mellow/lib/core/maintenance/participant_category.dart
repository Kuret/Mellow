/// One category of profile-owned state that lives outside the profile directory.
///
/// The single registry. Preferences, external files, shortcuts, scheduled jobs
/// and credentials all belong to a profile without being inside it, so a
/// directory-scoped operation cannot see them — each becomes a
/// participant, and each has to be described to the user in three different
/// voices: what a backup carried, what it left behind, and what a delete could
/// not enumerate.
///
/// Those descriptions used to be four hand-written prose arrays plus a policy
/// map keyed by string literals, none derived from the others. Adding a
/// participant meant five edits, and only the Kotlin one failed to compile.
/// Here it is one row, and the analyzer asks for every field.
///
/// [ParticipantCategory.name] is the participant id itself — the same string
/// native reports from `listMaintenanceParticipants` and names its staging
/// directory with — so there is no parallel id field to keep in step with it.
