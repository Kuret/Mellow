/// Which surface a computed tab order is meant for.
///
/// The tab tray and the always-on-screen surfaces (quick tab switcher, tab bar,
/// sequential navigation) render the *same* tabs in deliberately different
/// orders, and the difference is exactly the tray's own controls: the tab-type
/// and date filters, the title/URL/date sort, and which groups are collapsed.
/// Those live in the tray, are only adjustable there, and outlive it — the
/// filter options persist for a week and the collapsed set for the app session
/// — so letting them reach a surface the user is looking at while the tray is
/// closed makes that surface disagree with itself (issue #603).
///
/// Splitting the scope is what keeps them apart. It is a presentation
/// distinction only: both scopes group parents with their descendants and both
/// honour pinned-first, because those are structural preferences rather than
/// transient tray state.

  /// The tray's list and grid views: every tray control applies.

  /// The quick tab switcher, the tab bar and sequential tab navigation: no
  /// filter, no collapse and no tray sort.

  /// Nothing is ever removed from this order, so a tab the user can see is a
