/**
 * Holds one view-less GeckoSession open across startup, so Gecko runs the part
 * of its own startup that it gates on a chrome window existing.
 *
 * `GeckoSession.open()` is what creates `chrome://geckoview/content/geckoview.xhtml`,
 * and that window's script is the only thing on Android that notifies
 * `extensions-late-startup` and `browser-delayed-startup-finished`. Background
 * scripts of already-installed extensions wait on the first, via
 * `ExtensionParent.browserStartupPromise`; `SafeBrowsing.init()`,
 * `Blocklist.loadBlocklistAsync()` and `RemoteSecuritySettings.init()` are
 * scheduled next to it. Without a window none of it runs — which is why a cold
 * start that never opens a tab has no ad blocking and no native port from any
 * built-in extension: every one of them opens its bridge
 * with `browser.runtime.connectNative(...)` from a background script that has
 * not been allowed to start.
 *
 * The window needs no EngineView and no compositor, only the UI thread, so this
 * session is never rendered, never navigated and never put in the
 * `BrowserStore`. It exists as the window and nothing else, and it is given
 * back as soon as something else holds one. Closing the last window does not
 * shut Gecko down — `nsAppShell` enters `EnterLastWindowClosingSurvivalArea` —
 * and the notifications are one-shot, so the unblocking is permanent for the
 * process.
 *
 * The same technique, for the same underlying reason, is used for headless push
 * delivery in `Push.deliverMessage`.
