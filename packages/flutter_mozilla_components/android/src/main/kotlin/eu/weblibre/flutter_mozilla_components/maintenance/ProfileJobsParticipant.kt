/**
 * Cancels a profile's scheduled WorkManager jobs when its data is replaced or removed.
 *
 * Jobs are the one category here that is *not* user data: a queued job is a
 * pointer into state that lives inside the profile directory and therefore
 * already travels in the archive, so nothing is captured on the way out. What
 * matters is the other direction: a job left scheduled across a restore refers
 * to state from the data that was replaced, and one left scheduled across a
 * delete wakes against a profile directory that no longer exists.
 *
 * Re-scheduling is deliberately not this participant's job: whatever owns a
 * queue re-enqueues from its durable store whenever a profile becomes active, so
 * cancelling is a complete action rather than a lossy one — which is also why
 * rollback can be a no-op without leaving anything behind.
