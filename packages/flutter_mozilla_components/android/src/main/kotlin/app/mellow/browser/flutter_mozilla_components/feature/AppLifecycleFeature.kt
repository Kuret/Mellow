/**
 * Mirrors the process lifecycle into the [BrowserStore], and keeps the visible
 * session's content process bindable at foreground importance across it.
 *
 * Two things happen when the app is backgrounded. GeckoView destroys the
 * surface, which makes that session's `BrowsingContext` inactive, and three
 * seconds later (`dom.ipc.processPriorityManager.backgroundGracePeriodMS`)
 * Gecko recomputes that process' priority. From then on the only thing keeping
 * it bound with `BIND_IMPORTANT` instead of as a plain — and readily reaped —
 * background service is `BrowserParent::mPriorityHint`.
 *
 * That hint does not survive a process switch. It lives on the `BrowserParent`,
 * is initialised to `false`, and nothing carries it over when a cross-process
 * navigation builds a successor. Android Components sets it once, from
 * `SessionPrioritizationMiddleware`, on tab selection and engine-session
 * linking — neither of which a fission process switch produces. So a tab that
 * has navigated across origins since it was selected silently loses the only
 * protection it had, and is the first thing the OS takes under memory pressure.
 *
 * Re-applying on pause is what closes that: it is the moment the hint starts to
 * matter, and one call covers however many process switches happened while the
 * tab was in the foreground.
 *
 * See https://github.com/FaFre/WebLibre/issues/495.
