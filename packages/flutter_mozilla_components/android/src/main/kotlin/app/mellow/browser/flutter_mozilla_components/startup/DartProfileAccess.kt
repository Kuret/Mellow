 * may open it. They are different questions with different answers: a UI engine
 * and a background-fetch isolate agree on the profile and still must not both
 * hold a `ProviderContainer` over its databases, because each keeps its own
 * SQLite connections and its own in-memory view of rows the other is writing.
 *
 * Ownership lives here rather than in Dart because Dart cannot see across
 * isolates — two isolates would each observe an empty "nobody owns this".
 *
 * Waiting is deliberately not implemented here. A caller that finds the lease
 * taken retries from Dart, so no Pigeon call ever blocks the platform thread
 * waiting on another isolate to finish its work.
