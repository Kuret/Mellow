/**
 * The process's profile identity.
 *
 * All arbitration lives in [StartupArbiter]; this object is the Android-facing
 * side of it — it owns the `current_profile` write and hands out the one
 * [ProfileContext] the committed process is allowed to use.
 *
 * Two rules are load-bearing:
 *
 * - **Committed identity is immutable and is never re-derived from disk.** The old
 *   implementation reinterpreted `current_profile` on every call, which let a
 *   worker bind Gecko to profile A while Dart opened profile B's databases.
 * - **Writing the profile for a *future* process does not rebind this one.**
 *   `current_profile` is next-start state; the live process keeps serving whatever
 *   it committed until it dies.
