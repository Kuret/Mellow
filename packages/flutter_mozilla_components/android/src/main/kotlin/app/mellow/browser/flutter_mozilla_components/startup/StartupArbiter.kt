 *
 * ## Why this is native and not a Dart singleton
 *
 * Dart `main()` is not the definition of a process cold start. `MainActivity`
 * destroys its cached engine after a non-finishing destroy and can create a new
 * one in the same process, and workers/receivers/services can run with no Flutter
 * engine at all. Arbitration therefore has to live in process-global native state.
 *
 * ## Lock order
 *
 * `startup arbitration -> ActiveProfile profile lock`.
 *
 * Callbacks registered through [onCommitted] run *outside* this monitor, and each
 * is isolated so one failure cannot block the others.
 *
 * ## Watchdogs
 *
 * Deadlines are evaluated lazily on entry to every state-observing method rather
 * than by a background timer. A timer would add a second thread to the one piece
 * of state that must never be raced, and it would make the transition tests
 * depend on wall-clock timing.
